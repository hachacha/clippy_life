started this project with the intent of just keeping everything I copy in a database for notes for myself. the program is a little fickle and sometimes copies things without me copying it -- sometimes on a hilight and sometimes just whenever it wants. This isn't really undesireable because it gives a better sense of my full browsing history in a way that just saving every site I visit won't. 

next step for this is to add in something that will automatically save youtube videos to my remote server. Really tired of having my favorites disappear. Every link i copy will be ssh'd and pushed on to a server.

dreams: have a space on my website to go through the videos and view them off yt.
